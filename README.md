# Sorting-Visualizer

## Inspiration
Inspired by popular sorting algorithm visualization videos, we decided to make a website that compiles the visualizations together and offers the user more control.

## What it does
It visualizes sorting popular sorting algorithms in computer science and explains them.

## How we built it
We wrote it using just JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Challenges we ran into
We changed the requirements multiple times throughout the project. Managing to steer the project in such a direction that in fulfilled all the new requirements without introducing new bugs and keeping the code both understandable and efficient proved to be a challenge.
It was also a challenge to get the HTML and CSS to look nice.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of getting it done, and overcoming the challenges we overcame. We're also proud of making something that could be relatively helpful and educational to someone learning about sorting algorithms.

## What we learned
Lay requirements out in the beginning.
Try to make a project architecture that makes few assumptions about the direction in which the project will go.
Communicate what you're doing before pushing major code changes, or else there will be merge conflicts and people won't understand how your new code interacts with the rest of the code.

## What's next for Sorting Visualizer
We may add more sorting algorithms, or add more aesthetic modifications to the website. Also, we would like to add an interactive walkthrough of the sorting algorithms.
